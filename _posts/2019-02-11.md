Spent Sunday out at the lake with a few member's of Jim Russell's limnology class and Sydney Clark to gather measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, and nutrients with depth at Pout Pond in New Hampshire. We will see how the lake changes when the next group comes out in March to take another set of measurements!
