Brodie Pearson and I were fortunate to travel to Grand Isle, LA during the 2017 CARTHE Submesoscale Processes and Lagrangian Analysis on the ShelfÂ experiment. There were a lot of drifter releases, but we were mostly there to help with the driftcard releases to be observed aerially with drones. From these launches, we hope to gain information about ocean characteristics at the lower end of the submesoscale on the Louisiana shelf.
