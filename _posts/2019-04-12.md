Last week myself as well as Brown undergraduate Patrick Orenstein presented our paths to geoscience to 8 groups of 8th graders at Lincoln Middle School. We walked them through some of the exciting accomplishments of oceanographers, what it takes to become one, as well as our individual journeys. WeÂ  supplemented our talk with a mini turbulence demonstration thanks to some colorful mica powder and water. More info about LPS career days can be found in this short article.
