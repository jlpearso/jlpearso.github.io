This week I presented a poster to the audience of URI's annual RI EPSCoR/C-AIM research symposium as well as the Institute and Brown for Environment and Society's Earth Itself symposium on our observational follow up of our recent JPO paper. It was a great turnout of scientists from all disciplines working to better understand our environment, but also convert that knowledge to policy and make it accessible and approachable to the general public. Take a look at my posterÂ here.
