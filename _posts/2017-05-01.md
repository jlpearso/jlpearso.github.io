Our paper presenting a synthesis of mathematical traffic models, observation models, and data assimilation techniques to incorporate Eulerian and Lagrangian traffic flow observations into a macroscopic traffic model is now available. The paper can be found online here.

Key Points:

We develop and test methods to incorporate a variety of real-time traffic flow measurements from GPS, traffic sensors, traffic cameras, and cell phone data, etc. to predict macroscopic traffic flow.
We show these methods lead to accurate predictions regardless of which data assimilation technique, ensemble Kalman or particle filter, is used.
Both techniques allow for parameter estimation of difficult parameters to otherwise prescribe to the traffic models.
