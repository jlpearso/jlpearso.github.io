Abigail Bodner and I taught a 2 weekSummer @ Brown course on introductory oceanography  to 15 high school students from all over the world in late July. The session consisted of lectures, water tank experiments, python coding, a final research project, and a boat tour of Narragansett Bay as well as CTD casts, sediment grabs, a troll, a plankton tow, and drift card releases.  We had a really great time working with the students, and look forward to hearing from them in the future as well as teaching this course again next summer!
