excerpt: "Broadly, my interests are at the intersection of physical oceanography and biogeochemistry. I use statistical methods paired with models, observations, and theory to understand the transport and fate of tracers like oil, pathogens, and nutrients in the upper and coastal ocean, with emphasis on submesoscales."

    title: "Transport and Dispersion in Narragansett Bay"
    excerpt: "Structure functions are tools to estimate difficult biogeochemical parameters, and transit-time distributions give information about the transport and fate of pollutants, pathogens, and other tracers. I bridge physical and biogeochemical fields by developing structure function theories for reactive tracers in anisotropic turbulence and analyzing transit-time distributions to understand how river influxes of nutrients as well as oyster parasites propagate and spread in Narragansett Bay.  To the right is a video of a passive tracer advected and diffused by the Regional Ocean Modeling System. The tracer was released at two known source sites for Perkinsus Marinus , an oyster parasite detrimental to both wild and farmed oyster populations in the Bay."
