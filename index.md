I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences][cims], [NYU][nyu], exploring the richness of oceanic turbulence and transport. Prior to moving to New York, I received a PhD at the [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute, FSU][gfdi] in Tallahassee, Florida, and an undergraduate chemical engineering degree from the [Birla Institute of Technology and Science][bits] in [Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India).

My research is primarily focused on understanding how the [swirling flows](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=77120) in the ocean, at scales of 100m - 100km, stir, mix and transport tracers. This stirring and transport plays an integral role in influencing the [Earth's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5_GlAOCHyE) [climate](https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/), and also controls the rhythms of oceanic and coastal ecosystems. You can read about the few aspects of this rich problem, which I have addressed with colleagues, on my [research page](/research/), or download my [publications](/publications) for more details.

A summary of my professional life as a list can be found in my [curriculum vitae](/assets/documents/balwada_CV_Feb_2019.pdf).

I was born in the Indian state of [Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan), which is well known for the [Thar Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thar_Desert), and ancient palaces and forts (not for a lot of water bodies). I spent most of my childhood and teenage years in and around the capital city, [New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi), and went to the western coastal state of Goa to study engineering after high-school. Even though living next to some of the most beautiful beaches in India as an undergrad, I had to go back inland, for an internship to [Bangalore](http://www.cmmacs.ernet.in/), to discover that humans spent time studying the ocean. The opportunity to study the fluid dynamics of the turbulent natural environment and to be involved in fieldwork have been the primary hooks that have lead me to where I am now.
