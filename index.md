I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown University, where I am a GoMRI scholar funded by the Consortium for Advanced Research on Hydrocarbon Transport in the Environment. My research utilizes regional observational platforms to calculate upper ocean statistics to better understand physical impacts on oil distributions in the Gulf of Mexico as well as the transport and dispersion of nutrients, pollution, and oyster parasites in Narragansett Bay. I use structure functions, alongside other statistics, to isolate key scales and processes. Additionally I am interested in the utility of structure functions in a biogeochemical context. I am developing theory and validating it with a realistic regional ocean model to see what structure functions can tell us about reactive tracers in a turbulent fluid.

I have a B.A. in Applied Mathematics and also in Earth Science from Northeastern Illinois University where I was a MaPs Scholar.  I am passionate about teaching and outreach, and have worked as a MEWP peer leader, as well as an EMERGE peer leader throughout my undergraduate career. More recently, I have worked with Vartan Gregorian Elementary School in Providence, RI teaching 2nd and 3rd graders various science concepts, and have twice co-taught an introductory oceanography course through Summer@Brown to high school students intending to apply to colleges in the near future.
